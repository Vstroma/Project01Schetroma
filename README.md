# Project01Schetroma

// Project01 is a receation of the command ps which 
// displays a list of processes that are currently running as well as
// other information about processes that are running
// by opening different directories for reading.
// Project01 gave us more exercise with makefiles and parsing through the command line.
// It excepts flags through the command line using a struct.
// 


// For testing I ran code throughout creating my program
// while trying to debug.
